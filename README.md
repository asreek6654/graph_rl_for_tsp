# Graph Reinforcement Learning for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This repository contains all the code necessary to train and test a graph reinforcement learning agent to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This work was developed as part of Stanford's CS224W Final Project.

## Instructions

1. **Training and Testing**:
   - To train and test an agent, open and execute the cells in the `run_tsp.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Configuring Parameters**:
   - The model and training parameters can be adjusted in the `config.py` file. Modify the desired values before running the notebook. The current values are defaults that should yield reasonable results. 

## Files
- **`run_tsp.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook to train and test the TSP agent.
- **`config.py`**: Configuration file to adjust model and training parameters.
- **Other supporting scripts**: Files like `encoder.py`, `training.py`, and `utils.py` contain helper functions and core implementations for the project.
